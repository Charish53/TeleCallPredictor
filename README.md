# TeleCallPredictor - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **TeleCallPredictor** project focuses on understanding and predicting customer responses to telemarketing calls. Through this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover insights into customer behavior, identify key predictors of successful calls, and guide feature engineering and model development.

## Project Goals
- Perform comprehensive EDA to understand data distribution, patterns, and relationships.
- Identify critical features impacting customer responses to telemarketing calls.
- Prepare a baseline dataset for modeling and prediction.

## Analysis Outline

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - Overview of the dataset, including types of variables and missing data analysis.
   - Analyze distributions and summary statistics for each feature.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Explore individual features, focusing on key demographics, call history, and customer behavior metrics.
   - Identify potential outliers, anomalies, and typical customer characteristics.

3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**:
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
   - Explore feature interactions and their impact on the target variable (e.g., response to calls).

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into data structure.
   - Use heatmaps, box plots, scatter plots, and other relevant plots to reveal underlying patterns.

5. **Insights and Feature Selection**:
   - Summarize findings that reveal meaningful trends and predictors.
   - Prioritize features for model development based on insights from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate this EDA, youâ€™ll need:
- **Python 3.7+**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TeleCallPredictor.git
   cd TeleCallPredictor
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```

## Run the Analysis

1. **Load the Dataset**: Place the dataset file (e.g., `telecall_data.csv`) into the project directory.
2. **Open and Run the Notebook**: Launch `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset (`telecall_data.csv`) should be located in the root directory of the project. This dataset contains customer interaction data and metrics essential for EDA, such as:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, income, etc.
- **Call Details**: Duration, time of call, day of the week.
- **Customer Response**: Indicator of whether the customer responded positively or negatively to the call.

You can modify the dataset as needed by adding or removing features to align with analysis goals.

## Results

The EDA insights will highlight key features that drive customer responses, helping shape the **TeleCallPredictor** model and guiding further preprocessing and modeling steps.
