# TeleCallPredictor - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **TeleCallPredictor** project focuses on understanding and predicting customer responses to telemarketing calls. Through this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover insights into customer behavior, identify key predictors of successful calls, and guide feature engineering and model development.

## Project Goals
- Perform comprehensive EDA to understand data distribution, patterns, and relationships.
- Identify critical features impacting customer responses to telemarketing calls.
- Prepare a baseline dataset for modeling and prediction.

## Analysis Outline

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - Overview of the dataset, including types of variables and missing data analysis.
   - Analyze distributions and summary statistics for each feature.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Explore individual features, focusing on key demographics, call history, and customer behavior metrics.
   - Identify potential outliers, anomalies, and typical customer characteristics.

3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**:
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.
   - Explore feature interactions and their impact on the target variable (e.g., response to calls).

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into data structure.
   - Use heatmaps, box plots, scatter plots, and other relevant plots to reveal underlying patterns.

5. **Insights and Feature Selection**:
   - Summarize findings that reveal meaningful trends and predictors.
   - Prioritize features for model development based on insights from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate this EDA, youâ€™ll need:
- **Python 3.7+**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TeleCallPredictor.git
   cd TeleCallPredictor


   Run the Analysis
Load the dataset (e.g., telecall_data.csv) into the project directory.
Open and run the EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis.
Dataset
Place the dataset file (telecall_data.csv) in the root directory of the project. This dataset should contain customer interaction data and metrics relevant for EDA, such as:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, income, etc.
Call Details: Duration, time of call, day of the week.
Customer Response: Indicator of whether the customer responded positively or negatively to the call.
The dataset can be modified as required to include or exclude features depending on the analysis goals.

Results
The EDA insights will help shape the TeleCallPredictor model by highlighting essential features that drive customer response, guiding further preprocessing and modeling steps.
